# Lab 0: Setting up your environment 

If a lab environment has not be provided for you, this lab provides the instructions to get started in your own Azure Subscription.

The following summarizes the lab requirements if you want to setup your own environment (for example, on your local machine). If this is your first time performing these labs, it is highly recommended you follow the Quick Start instructions below rather that setup your own environment from scratch.

The labs have the following requirements:
- Azure subscription. You will need a valid and active Azure account to complete this Azure lab. If you do not have one, you can sign up for a [free trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/).
- One of the following environments:
    - [Azure Notebook VMs](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/machine-learning/)
    - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/setup-overview)
- For the deep learning lab, you will need a [Azure Machine Learning compute cluster](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/service/how-to-set-up-training-targets#amlcompute) with GPU capabilities.

Depending on which environment you use, there are different requirements. The following sections describe the setup process for each environment.
